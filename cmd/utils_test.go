// Note: The conceptual mocks (setup/restore functions and *_CallCount vars) are not fully utilized
// because the functions in utils.go and cleaner.go are called directly, not via swappable variables.
// The tests are therefore more like integration tests for those parts.
// A cleaner.NoOpDB() or similar from the gorm library might be useful if available,
// or a test database instance (like in-memory sqlite) for more controlled DB tests.
// For IsDirectory, we rely on actual filesystem state.
// For InitLogger, we don't have an easy way to check if it was called.
// The test for "DBInitializationFails" is particularly difficult to make robust without mocking.
// It's more of a "if the DB happens to fail, does our wrapper report it as expected?"
// rather than "can we force a DB failure and test our handling of it?".
